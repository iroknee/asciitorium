# asciitorium

**asciitorium** (pronounced ascii-or-ium, similar to plane-arium seen [here](https://youtu.be/oK5n9lPvaQk?feature=shared&t=5)) is an ASCII-based UI framework that runs in both the web and CLI. Designed to help develop CLI interfaces quickly. Originally it was purposed to allow a Gen Xer to build games to the flavor of Wizardry I, Zork, etc. but frankly has gotten out of hand.

## Installation

**Recommended:** Create a new asciitorium project using the create tooling:

```bash
npm create asciitorium my-app
```

or add asciitorium to your existing project:

```bash
npm install asciitorium
```
